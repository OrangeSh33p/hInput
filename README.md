Hinput is the ultimate tool for artists and designers looking for a straightforward way of accessing gamepad inputs, as well as experienced developers in need of a lightweight versatile interface.

ðŸŽ® **Write it as you think it**
The Hinput interface is the most intuitive gamepad API on the Asset store. Its simple wording allows you to call it quickly and easily, without having to constantly look up the documentation.

ðŸŽ® **Plug and play**
Hinput works right out of the box: you do not need to set up any key maps or control bindings before using it. It does all the heavy lifting of assigning the proper controls to each player, so that you can focus on creating your game right away.

ðŸŽ® **Multi-platform support**
The plugin features built-in cross-platform support. Hinput automatically detects the player's OS, and adapts at runtime to Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as WebGL and Xbox builds. You don't need to do anything!

ðŸŽ® **Rumble**
Hinput gives you access to vibration on Windows for up to 4 gamepads. You can adjust the duration and intensity of the rumble, and access a selection of fine-tuned vibration presets.

ðŸŽ® **Easy to learn**
Two simple step-by-step guides will teach you how to install and use Hinput in a matter of minutes. If you prefer a more hands-on approach, Hinput also features an interactive example scene with visual feedback on how to use the API, as well as a debug scene that will allow you to test every single feature of the plugin and log them to the console.

ðŸŽ® **In-depth documentation**
The plugin features a detailed API reference, describing the behavior of each class and how to use them best. This documentation is reflected directly into the code, so that you don't even have to open your web browser. Every single class, property and method is commented!

ðŸŽ® **Open source initiative**
Hinput is a free open tool, created for the Unity community. Its source code is public, and you are welcome to tweak it to your own needs, and to contribute to the project on Github.

ðŸŽ® **Reliable developer support**
The plugin is contantly updated with new features, API improvements and bug fixes. If you have questions, remarks or requests you can email **hello@hinput.co** to receive immediate support from the developer.
